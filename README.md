Objective
Containerize the three.js editor application using Docker and provide deployment automation scripts.

Tasks

Application Containerization
Clone the three.js editor repository from GitHub (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/editor).
Create a Dockerfile to build a Docker image for the three.js editor application.
Ensure that the application runs correctly within the Docker container.
Document the steps to build the Docker image and run the containerized application locally.

Deployment Automation Script
Develop a deployment automation script (e.g., Bash, Python, or Ansible playbook) that can deploy the containerized three.js editor application to a simulated client environment.
The script should perform the following tasks:
Check if Docker is installed on the target machine and install it if necessary.
Pull the Docker image for the three.js editor application from a specified registry or local build.
Start the Docker container with the appropriate configuration (e.g., port mappings, volume mounts).
Verify that the application is running and accessible.

Configuration Management
Store the Dockerfile, deployment automation script, and any related files in a version control system like Git.
Document the process for cloning the repository and running the deployment script on a new target machine.

Deliverables
A Dockerfile for building a Docker image of the three.js editor application.
A deployment automation script that can deploy the containerized three.js editor application to a simulated client environment.
Documentation for building the Docker image and running the containerized application locally.
Documentation for cloning the repository, configuring the target environment, and running the deployment automation script.
